'Perfection is not optional here; it’s our language,' Sharma states. Every pattern is hand-cut, every lining chosen with precision — because luxury lives in the details."

      "text": "In the atelier, time slows down. Artisans spend up to 200 hours crafting a single jacket, blending centuries-old embroidery techniques from Lucknow with contemporary Italian tailoring. Each coat, dress, and suit is a harmonious balance between tradition and modern design, elevating everyday garments into timeless heirlooms."

'Our customers aren’t just buying fashion; they’re inheriting a piece of living craftsmanship,' says Sharma."

    {
      "type": "paragraph",
      "text": "The journey begins with sourcing. Velvét's fabrics come from handpicked mills in Como, Italy, and local weavers in Varanasi, India. 'We only use wool that breathes, silk that glides, and cotton that feels like second skin,' explains Sharma. Sustainability is key — 70% of the atelier’s materials are now eco-certified, in line with Velvét’s pledge to go 100% sustainable by 2030."

Each piece is custom-fitted, reflecting not just the wearer’s measurements but their personality. 'Our atelier doesn’t just dress bodies, it tells stories,' Sharma emphasizes."

    {
      "type": "paragraph",
      "text": "Looking ahead, Velvét plans to open its atelier doors to clients through exclusive tours, offering them a rare glimpse into the craftsmanship behind their garments. For Sharma, this is the future of luxury: transparency, tradition, and timelessness, woven together in every thread."

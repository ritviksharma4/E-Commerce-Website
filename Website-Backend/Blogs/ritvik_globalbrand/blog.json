      "text": "Like many great ventures, Velvét faced its fair share of challenges in the early days. Supply chain disruptions, skepticism from industry gatekeepers, and the struggle to fund artisanal production were daily battles. 'Resilience was everything,' Sharma says. 'We had to stay firm in our belief that there was space for a brand that combined heritage craft with modern performance.'"

      "text": "Sharma's 'uncompromising eye for detail' is legendary within the brand. Every jacket, dress, and coat undergoes multiple rounds of refinement before reaching the customer. From hand-finished seams to custom-dyed linings, no element is too small to escape scrutiny. 'Luxury is built in the details that most people will never even notice — but they feel it,' he says."

      "type": "paragraph",
      "text": "'Building a brand is never finished,' Sharma reflects. 'It’s a living, breathing thing that evolves with the times — but the soul must always stay intact.' And with Velvét, that soul remains stronger than ever."

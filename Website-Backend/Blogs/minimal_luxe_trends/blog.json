      "type": "paragraph",
      "text": "Sharma describes the collection as a 'return to purity.' Every seam, drape, and cut is intentional, crafted to enhance the natural movement of the body. 'Minimal Luxe is not about doing less — it’s about doing better with less,' he explains. This ethos resonates with a new generation of consumers seeking timelessness over trend-chasing."

      "type": "paragraph",
      "text": "The pieces are designed to be modular — a blazer from the collection can transition from boardroom meetings to red carpet events, simply by switching accessories. 'We want to empower our clients to buy fewer items but wear them in infinite ways,' Sharma adds, highlighting Velvét’s commitment to sustainable luxury."

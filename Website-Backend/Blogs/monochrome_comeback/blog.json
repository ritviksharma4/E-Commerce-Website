      "text": "The result? A monochrome wardrobe that feels anything but basic. Think sharply tailored blazers with tonal embroidery, fluid silk gowns that catch the light in unexpected ways, and coats detailed with handwoven patterns that emerge only upon closer inspection. 'Monochrome is not absence of color; it’s the purest expression of contrast and harmony,' Sharma explains."

'In a world obsessed with excess, our black-and-white story offers clarity — a return to essence,' Sharma reflects."

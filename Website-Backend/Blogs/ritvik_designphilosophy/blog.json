      "text": "At the heart of Velvét’s design philosophy lies a paradox: to remain classic while constantly disrupting. 'Every piece must feel timeless but also futuristic in its feel and fit,' Sharma explains. This guiding principle informs everything — from the silhouette of a jacket to the invisible technologies woven into the fabrics."

      "text": "Velvét’s atelier draws inspiration from traditional European tailoring, but the execution leans heavily on innovation. 'We study archival designs from the 1950s and 60s, then ask ourselves — how do we make this relevant for the next 50 years?' Sharma says. The result is clothing that feels both familiar and thrillingly new."

      "text": "From thermoregulating silks that adapt to body temperature to stretchable velvets that maintain structure, Velvét is pushing the boundaries of textile science. In collaboration with mills in Como, Italy and Kyoto, Japan, the brand is developing fabrics that are as functional as they are luxurious."

    {
      "type": "paragraph",
      "text": "'We want our clients to feel the heritage in every thread but also experience comfort and performance they didn’t expect from couture-level pieces,' Sharma notes. The recent introduction of moisture-wicking linings and wrinkle-resistant evening wear has been particularly well-received by Velvét’s global clientele."

      "text": "Sharma’s design outlook is deeply influenced by his travels across fashion capitals — from Paris to Seoul to New York. 'Our customer is a global citizen. They appreciate Indian embroidery, Japanese minimalism, and Italian tailoring — often all in the same outfit,' he reflects."

    {
      "type": "paragraph",
      "text": "This multicultural approach is evident in Velvét’s latest lines, which blend handwoven Indian brocades with sleek Western silhouettes and cutting-edge Japanese fabrics. It’s a synthesis that appeals to a new generation of luxury buyers who value authenticity, versatility, and global aesthetics."

    {
      "type": "paragraph",
      "text": "For Ritvik Sharma, Velvét’s future lies in staying true to its design DNA — classic yet disruptive, heritage-driven yet tech-forward. 'We are here to honor tradition, but never to be trapped by it,' he says with a smile. And in that delicate balance, Velvét continues to shape the future of fashion."

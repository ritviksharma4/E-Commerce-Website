'The future is fluid,' he declares, emphasizing that rigid gender boundaries in fashion will continue to dissolve. Sharma envisions collections that embrace gender-fluid silhouettes, offering versatility and self-expression for all. Velvét’s upcoming lines will feature flowing forms, tailored pieces that defy traditional gender categories, and an overall aesthetic that champions individuality over conformity."

      "text": "But it’s not just about aesthetics — it’s about ethics. Sharma stresses the urgent need for eco-conscious materials in the luxury sector. 'Luxury is evolving — it must be ethical, inclusive, and intelligent,' he states. For Velvét, this means expanding its use of organic fibers, recycled fabrics, and innovative plant-based leathers. The brand has already begun forging partnerships with green-tech companies and ethical suppliers to ensure its 2030 sustainability pledge is not just met, but exceeded."

      "text": "Another trend Sharma predicts will dominate 2025 is the integration of artificial intelligence in tailoring. With AI-assisted design tools, Velvét plans to offer clients hyper-personalized fashion experiences. From digital fittings that use body scanning technology to custom designs generated through machine learning algorithms, Sharma believes technology will not replace craftsmanship but will enhance it. 'AI is not the enemy of couture,' he tells Vogue. 'It is its future partner.'"

      "text": "The interview also touches on the growing influence of younger consumers who demand authenticity and accountability from the brands they support. Sharma acknowledges that Gen Z and Millennials are driving the shift toward ethical luxury, and Velvét intends to lead that charge. 'Today’s customer wants more than a beautiful dress — they want a story, a purpose, and proof that their purchase contributes to something larger,' Sharma explains."

      "text": "Looking ahead, Sharma hints at several collaborations that will embody these values, including partnerships with artists and technologists who share Velvét’s commitment to sustainability and innovation. Though he remains tight-lipped on details, he promises that 2025 will be a landmark year for the brand and for the broader fashion industry. 'We are not following trends,' Sharma concludes. 'We are creating them.'"

      "text": "As the conversation with Vogue wraps up, it’s clear that Ritvik Sharma's vision transcends fashion. His blueprint for 2025 champions a future where luxury is redefined — not just by opulence and craftsmanship, but by inclusivity, intelligence, and responsibility. With leaders like Sharma at the helm, the fashion world appears poised for a revolution that is as ethical as it is elegant."

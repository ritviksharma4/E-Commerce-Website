      "text": "The collaboration brings together two cultural giants: the global phenomenon of BTS and the luxurious craftsmanship of Velvét. Known for their fashion-forward style, BTS members each infused their personal style into the collection, creating a line that is as diverse and dynamic as the group itself. The collection features a mix of streetwear and couture influences, including oversized blazers, cargo trousers, and silk bombers — all with a touch of Velvét’s signature refinement. The oversized blazers, for instance, are tailored with the precision Velvét is known for, yet they have the relaxed, cool vibe that BTS fans love."

      "text": "One of the most striking elements of the collection is its fusion of high-end materials and streetwear aesthetics. The oversized blazers are crafted from Italian wool blends, providing both comfort and luxury. The cargo trousers, another highlight of the line, are made from durable yet soft fabric, making them perfect for both casual outings and more polished looks. The silk bombers add an element of high fashion, bringing sophistication to a traditionally casual piece. Each item in the collection has been designed to reflect the energy of BTS while maintaining Velvét’s reputation for uncompromising quality and craftsmanship."

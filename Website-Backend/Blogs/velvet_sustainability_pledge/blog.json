      "text": "Founder Ritvik Sharma made the announcement at a prestigious summit in Paris, stating, 'Luxury must evolve — we will lead that change.' His words resonated deeply with the global fashion community, underscoring Velvét’s commitment to not only maintaining its high standards of luxury but also aligning with the planet’s needs. Sharma went on to emphasize that this initiative is not just about using sustainable materials, but about ensuring that every aspect of Velvét's supply chain, from sourcing to production, is ethically and environmentally responsible. By 2030, the brand aims to completely eliminate the use of non-sustainable fabrics, replacing them with organic, recycled, or biodegradable alternatives. This step is expected to make a significant impact on the global luxury fashion industry, pushing other brands to follow suit."

      "text": "To fulfill its pledge, Velvét will work closely with a select group of ethical suppliers and green technology innovators, ensuring that all materials are sourced from environmentally friendly and socially responsible suppliers. This will include partnerships with textile manufacturers who specialize in organic cotton, hemp, and recycled fabrics, as well as those who are pioneers in creating innovative, sustainable fabrics such as lab-grown leather and plant-based synthetics. Velvét is also looking at ways to reduce its carbon footprint across all production processes, including transitioning to renewable energy sources and adopting more sustainable packaging solutions. These efforts are part of a broader industry-wide push to meet the growing consumer demand for sustainable fashion and to help combat the fashion industry's reputation as one of the world’s most polluting industries."

These collections will showcase how luxury and sustainability can go hand in hand, with pieces that maintain the same level of sophistication and style that Velvét is known for, while also offering customers a more ethical alternative to traditional luxury fashion. With sustainability becoming a key priority for a new generation of conscious consumers, Velvét’s move is expected to resonate particularly with younger, environmentally aware shoppers who are demanding more from the brands they support."

      "text": "Velvét’s commitment to sustainability also extends beyond the products it creates. The brand will prioritize responsible waste management, ensuring that as much waste as possible from production processes is recycled or repurposed. Additionally, Velvét plans to explore options for taking back used items from customers through a circular fashion initiative, where products that have reached the end of their lifecycle can be returned, recycled, or upcycled into new creations. This initiative reflects the growing trend in fashion towards a more circular economy, where products are designed to be reused and recycled, minimizing waste and reducing the need for new resources."

As the brand moves towards 2030, it will continue to innovate and lead by example, showing the world that luxury fashion and sustainability are not mutually exclusive but rather complementary forces that can work together to create a more responsible and ethical fashion landscape."
